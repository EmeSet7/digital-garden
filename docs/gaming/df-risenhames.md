### Spring

#### Infrastructure  

Entrance to the fort.  
Dormitory, small farm plot, still and small workshop (stone and wood work) was established.  
Dinning hall with metting area was defined and costructed.  
Stockpiles were implemented.  
Wood is defined.  
Pasture is defined as well. 

#### Animals

Only same sex animals from the species worth breeding, we need to trade some animals in the next trader visit.  
Some animals have aged.  

#### Population

Stray dog has matured, bredding of dogs is now possible.  

#### Military

War dog training into consideration.  

### Summer

#### Infrastructure

More rooms were created, a room for pray has been hollowed out but we do not have enough dwarves to pray  
The butcher shop and trading post will be relocated inside, defenses are a priority even in a seemingly peaceful place  
Some more workshops were made, the fort is looking a bit confusing, a stair going down was ordered and a more organized fort will be planed out below  
Offices were also improvised beside our hall  

#### Population

Some migrantes came, it seems they brough 2 dwarves children, how nice  
Some animals came too, a pet lamb and a donkey  

#### Military

One of the dogs found funny to bit a horse and latching on to him  
The remainig dogs started to attack the horse  
In the confusion, Shorast became a militia commander and recruited 2 more dwarves to take down the horse, thinking it was him that started it all and the dogs were in danger  
Nil and Zefon followed Shorast and took the horse down, blood and teeth were scatered in the main corridor but it served as a reminder, we need to be ready for the real deal
