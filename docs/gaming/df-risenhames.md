## Year 100

### Spring

#### Infrastructure

Entrance to the fort.  
Dormitory, small farm plot, still and small workshop (stone and wood work) was established.  
Dinning hall with metting area was defined and costructed.  
Stockpiles were implemented.  
Wood is defined.  
Pasture is defined as well. 

#### Animals

Only same sex animals from the species worth breeding, we need to trade some animals in the next trader visit.  
Some animals have aged.  

#### Population

Stray dog has matured, bredding of dogs is now possible.  

#### Military

War dog training into consideration.  

### Summer

#### Infrastructure

More rooms were created, a room for pray has been hollowed out but we do not have enough dwarves to pray  
The butcher shop and trading post will be relocated inside, defenses are a priority even in a seemingly peaceful place, specially after the horse incident  
Some more workshops were made, the fort is looking a bit confusing, a stair going down was ordered and a more organized fort will be planned out below  
Offices were also improvised beside our hall, the bookeeper Imush is hard at work    

#### Population

Some migrantes came, it seems they brough 2 dwarves children, how nice , promply (after some in truth) childern were forbiden of labor. They will age and work for many years, we don't want them to resent the creator for working when still a child   
Some animals came too, a pet lamb and a donkey. the Lamb is named Eden, a male  

#### Military

One of the dogs found funny to bit a horse and latching on to him  
The remainig dogs started to attack the horse, riping it from all types of fat  
In the confusion, Shorast became a militia commander and recruited 2 more dwarves to take down the horse, thinking it was him that started it all and the dogs were in danger  
Nil and Zefon followed Shorast and took the horse down, blood and teeth were scatered in the main corridor but it served as a reminder, we need to be ready for the real deal  


#### Events

The dogs were at a horse again, this time the dwarves let it be as it was far and the horse was just running from here  

### Autumn

#### Events

Miasma has erupted in the corridor, right by the horse that is dead for months and apparentlly isn't worth taking out to the refuse pile  
After some more rearranging of the stockpiles the horse body was removed or so is thought because is no longer there  
A Caravan arrived, time to get some goods and hopefully some more animals for food  
And a hard realisation hits the fort... We don't have many worthy items, not to say none, we might have to sell of some animals to get the "right" sex ones  
A bunch of dingos appeared and apparentlly some tried to enter the fort, one was caught in the traps, fortunatelly
It's time to hide inside given this "attack", 11 dingos on the loose, 1 more caged  
The population hidden for a bit but the dingos didn't seem that great of a threat so they will keep an eye of each other but free to work again  

#### Infrastrures

The downstairs "fort" is going well, is being planned all the way, oak floors, feather wood in the rooms, smooth walls, nice doors (all the same materials). It's going along  

#### Trading

Some gems were traded for a female donkey
The caravan had an intersting scrool but way to expensive for our humble fort for now
We requested some yak cows for next year, we might have more goods then and trade in a companion to our male yak  

#### Population

Some more migrants arrived and soon after all tasks were defined  
They arrived just in time, more working hands were indeed needed. Dormitory needs an urgent expansion

#### Animals

The dogs made puppies, one puppy but, enough for now  
Soon after 2 more puppies born, it was more that one after all  

### Winter

#### Animals

Very uneventful winter, a cat has grown up and the rooms construction on the lower floor is coming along, soon some bed rooms will be assigned
Now the dingo, the caged and being trained in our fort one is picking a fight, on the first interaction we stay put but ready, the squad was called
Soon after, said dingo, reverted to wild so... time to take it out  
Some open arteries and severed parts later the dingo is dealt with, all normal again  
Some stuff happened after all
