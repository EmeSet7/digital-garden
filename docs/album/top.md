##The ones that really stuck in

To start, 2025 gave me a gut wrenching album "Polar (Traveller's Log)" by Gabriel Ólafs
The commentary really males it vone alive, I feel there, alone, freezing
What an amazing piece of music

Others should also be mentioned, there are plenty of albums that stuck with me
