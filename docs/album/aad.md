#Album a Day

##Guidelines

At least an album a day for the week, meaning that each week has a minimum of 7 albums, Saturdays and Sundays may become difficult to research and listen to an album so those 2 albums from those days might be picked up earlier in the week

Research will ve conducted in the "Album of the Year" website, were I will be picking an album from the top 10 to 25 from each year for a diferent decade each 2 months, so:
  January and February will be 1970s for day 1 lets say I pick one from the top ten of 1970, day 2 from 1971, amd so one without skipping a year so from 1970 to 79 in 60 days, in order, no maximum per year, at least one each year
  Marxh and April 1980-1989...
  
Fridays can be used for weakly releases, meaning, if there is an album to be release that week, it can be used as the album for Friday.

Fridays can also be used to a personal pick, aswell as Mondays

Special seasons can be used as a theme for albums, respecting the year and order we are in.

Holidays or/and vacations can be flacky and i might bow even show up, those days het backlogged, they have ro
